                Be part of the team that makes Leitrim Pride happen! Leitrim Pride is a community effort – invaluable hours of volunteering make the festival everything, ranging from members of the community joining the committee and planning teams, to members of the community helping with decorations and stewarding at the Pride March. Leitrim Pride puts Visibility to the fore for many rural living LGBTI+ folk – we celebrate, commemorate and protest to create this much needed visibility. We also host events as part of our LGBTI+ Community & Arts Festival.

                Can you help out by volunteering some of your time? Folks get involved for a variety of reasons: to make a stand for Equality, to give back to the community, to gain new skills and experiences and to make new friends. All we ask for is a commitment to making Leitrim Pride the best it can be and be ready to pull up those sleeves and get stuck in.
