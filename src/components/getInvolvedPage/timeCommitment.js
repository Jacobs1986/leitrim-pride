                We need folks who can donate 2-3 hours for events crew over the week, stewards are needed for the Pride Route and the Pride in the Park event afterwards. Ideally weâ€™d like folks who can be around for the 3-4 hours of this event.
            </p>

                Looking for something a little slower paced? We got you. Many of our mid-week events as well as our Saturday Pride Night event need a few people on the door for an hour or so.
